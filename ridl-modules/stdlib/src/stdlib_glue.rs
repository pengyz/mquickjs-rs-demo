// Placeholder glue module.
//
// NOTE: This crate is currently wired as a regular dependency of the demo app,
// while RIDL glue generation happens in the app-level build pipeline.
//
// For now, keep this module empty so the crate can compile. The stdlib C-side
// registration is provided via mquickjs_ridl_register.h injection.
